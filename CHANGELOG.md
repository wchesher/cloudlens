### Design Decisions

**Why TOML for Configuration?**
- Human-readable and writable
- Native CircuitPython support (in 9.0+)
- Clear structure for nested configuration
- Educational: teaches configuration management

**Why Separate Settings and Secrets?**
- Security: Secrets never committed to git
- Shareability: Settings can be shared publicly
- Educational: Demonstrates security best practices
- Flexibility: Different credentials per device

**Why No Hardcoded Values?**
- Maintainability: Changes in one place
- Flexibility: Easy customization
- Educational: Best practice demonstration
- Reusability: Same code, different configs

**Why Extensive Documentation?**
- Educational focus: Students need guidance
- Accessibility: Welcoming to all skill levels
- Maintainability: Clear for future contributors
- Professionalism: Ready for public scrutiny

### Supported Hardware
- CircuitPython 9.0+ compatible boards
- ESP32-S3 with camera (recommended)
- Requires WiFi and camera support

### Known Limitations
- Requires active internet connection
- API rate limits apply (Anthropic's terms)
- Image size limited by device memory
- 2.4GHz WiFi only (ESP32 limitation)

### Educational Use Cases
