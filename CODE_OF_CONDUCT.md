# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

CloudFX is an educational project dedicated to teaching computer science concepts in a welcoming, inclusive environment. We pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Be Welcoming**: Remember that everyone is learning. Some are students, some are educators, some are hobbyists.
- **Be Respectful**: Disagreement is okay, but be respectful in discussions.
- **Be Patient**: Not everyone has the same level of experience. Help others learn.
- **Be Constructive**: Offer helpful suggestions and constructive criticism.
- **Be Encouraging**: Celebrate others' successes and progress.
- **Assume Good Intent**: Give people the benefit of the doubt.

### Educational Context

This is a teaching project, so:

- **Questions are Welcome**: No question is "too basic"
- **Mistakes are Learning**: Errors in code or understanding are opportunities to learn
- **Share Knowledge**: If you know something, help others learn it too
- **Document Well**: Help others by explaining your code and decisions
- **Think of Students**: Consider that students may read your code and comments

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal attacks

## Educational Philosophy

As an educational project, we believe:

### Everyone Can Learn

- Programming is a learned skill, not an innate talent
- Different people learn at different paces
- Mistakes are part of the learning process
- Questions help everyone learn (not just the person asking)

### Teaching is Sharing

- If you know something, help others learn it
- Explain not just "what" but "why"
- Share resources and learning paths
- Be patient with those learning

### Diversity Strengthens Learning

- Different perspectives improve the project
- Varied backgrounds bring valuable insights
- Inclusive environments enhance education
- Everyone has something to contribute
