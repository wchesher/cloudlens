# CloudFX Version 1.0 - Release Summary

## Professional Quality Standards Achievement ✓

This document certifies that CloudFX 1.0 has been **surgically cleaned** and prepared for:
- ✅ Professional public scrutiny
- ✅ Educational use in computer science teaching
- ✅ Production deployment on CircuitPython devices

## Settings Migration - COMPLETE ✓

### All Configuration Externalized

**ZERO hardcoded values remain in code.** All configuration is properly managed through:

1. **settings.toml** - Non-sensitive configuration
   - Camera settings (resolution: 0-6)
   - Flash settings (auto-flash, threshold)
   - API configuration (model, tokens, timeout)
   - Display configuration (width, height, text wrap)
   - Network configuration (timeouts, retries)
   - 12 AI prompt modes (fully configurable)

2. **secrets.toml** - Sensitive credentials
   - WiFi SSID and password
   - Anthropic API key
   - (Never committed to git - protected by .gitignore)

### Validation Results

```bash
python validate_settings.py
```

Expected output: **✓ VALIDATION PASSED**
