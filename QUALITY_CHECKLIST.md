## Quality Metrics

Aim for these metrics:

### Code

- **Functions**: < 50 lines each (prefer < 30)
- **Files**: < 500 lines each (prefer < 300)
- **Docstring coverage**: 100% of public functions
- **Comment density**: ~15-20% of code lines

### Documentation

- **README**: Complete and up-to-date
- **Setup time**: < 30 minutes for experienced user
- **Setup documentation**: Step-by-step, testable

### Responsiveness

- **Issues**: Acknowledged within 48 hours

### Clarity

- Code is understandable by intermediate programmers
- Concepts are explained in comments
- Examples are simple and focused

### Safety

- No mature content in defaults
- Privacy-conscious (no data collection)
- Security best practices demonstrated

### Inclusivity

- Welcoming to all skill levels
- Examples don't assume cultural context
- Language is professional and kind

### Pedagogical Value

- Encourages exploration
- Supports learning objectives

## Definition of "Done"

A feature or fix is "done" when:

1. ✅ Code is written and tested
2. ✅ Settings are externalized (no hardcoding)
3. ✅ Documentation is updated
4. ✅ Examples work
5. ✅ Code is reviewed
6. ✅ Validation script passes
7. ✅ Changes are committed with clear message
8. ✅ Educational value is preserved or enhanced

## Signs of Technical Debt

Watch for these warning signs:

- ⚠️ Hardcoded values appearing in code
- ⚠️ Skipped error handling
- ⚠️ Undocumented "magic" numbers
- ⚠️ Commented-out code accumulating
- ⚠️ Copy-pasted code blocks
- ⚠️ Overly complex functions
- ⚠️ Incomplete docstrings
- ⚠️ Outdated documentation

Address technical debt promptly!
