DESCRIBE_LABEL = "DESCRIBE"
DESCRIBE_PROMPT = """Please describe what is in this image. The description should be in the style of alt text used on social media sites like Mastodon. Avoid talking about the quality of the image. Avoid talking about the background of the image. Only describe the main subject."""

HAIKU_LABEL = "HAIKU"
HAIKU_PROMPT = """Please identify the main subject of the image and write a haiku about it. It should be a three line poem that consists of three lines, with five syllables in the first line, seven in the second, and five in the third. It does not need to rhyme. Only return the haiku, no image description is necessary. Please insert a * between each line instead of a comma (,)."""

Be specific and educational."""

TRANSLATE_LABEL = "TRANSLATE"

WEIRD_LABEL = "WEIRD?"
WEIRD_PROMPT = """Take in the full image as context. Is there anything in the image that is out of the ordinary or interesting? For example, if the image is of a backyard, do you see any animals or objects that catch your eye? You do not need to comment on the quality of the image. Please keep responses brief and concise, between one to two sentences. If you do not see anything out of the ordinary for the context of the image or anything particularly interesting, please return: Nothing to see here."""

Please insert a * between each line instead of a comma (,)."""

DRAMA_LABEL = "DRAMA"
DRAMA_PROMPT = """You are writing a dramatic soap opera scene. The object in this photo is the STAR of the show. Give it a name, a personality, a secret, a rival, and a dramatic backstory.

STUDY_LABEL = "STUDY BUDDY"
STUDY_PROMPT = """You are a patient tutor. This image shows notes, a textbook page, a worksheet, or study materials. Based on what you see: 1) Identify the subject and topic, 2) Create 3 practice questions about this material, 3) Provide one memory trick or mnemonic device, 4) Suggest one real-world application of this concept. Be encouraging and educational."""

Based on this image, describe: 1) What act of kindness, care, or connection do you observe? 2) What emotions might the people involved be feeling? 3) Why do small moments like this matter? 4) How might this kindness ripple outward? Be warm, optimistic, and highlight the positive aspects of human connection. Even in ordinary scenes, find the kindness."""
