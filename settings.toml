# PROMPT ENGINEERING FRAMEWORK GUIDE
# ============================================
# CloudLens prompts follow a 5-component structure designed to teach
# effective AI prompt engineering:
#
# 1. ROLE - Who is the AI? (establishes expertise & perspective)
# 2. ATTITUDE - How do they communicate? (sets tone & personality)
# 3. TASK - What's the core objective? (clear, specific action)
# 4. CONSTRAINTS - What are the boundaries? (rules, limits, focus)
# 5. OUTPUT FORMAT - How is it structured? (exact format specification)
#
# PROMPT QUALITY RATINGS (visible on viewfinder as stars):
# Quality 1 (*) = Straightforward tasks, quick information
# Quality 2 (**) = Creative interpretation, moderate complexity
# Quality 3 (***) = Deep analysis, multi-part, high insight potential
#
# Students: Study these prompts to master AI instruction design!
# Try modifying ROLE, ATTITUDE, or CONSTRAINTS to see how responses change.
